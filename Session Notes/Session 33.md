## Journey to the Tower

The group sets off towards [[The Tower]] with [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]]. On the hour-and-a-half journey, [[Shalooti]] ponders how she might tame her polar bear once her spell wears off.

Near the end of the trip, the group hears wolves howling in the woods. [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] leaps into action, pulling her crossbow off her back and delivering two well-aimed slivered bolts into the woods. The howling immediately stops.

[[Escher]] and [[Anakir]] hold hands for most of the journey.

## The Tower on Lake Baratok

The party finally arrives at the lake. They see a small causeway leading over the water out to an old worn-down tower in the middle. There are deep tire tracks in the mud leading from the tower. When [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] sees them, she swears under her breath and takes off following the tracks into the woods, shouting to the party to go on without her.

## Dancing at the Door

[[Pelanil]] hesitates, but then follows after [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]]. The rest of the group heads towards the tower. [[Elora]] knocks on the door, but is blown backwards as the tower is consumed by blue lightning. From a distance, [[Elora]] more closely examines the door when she realizes the sign depicts a dance. [[Shalooti]] knows exactly what to do. She busts a move!

Once she finishes all the dance moves, the lightning stops and the door creaks open, revealing a small vestibule with lovely curtains ([[Bardolf]] snatches them immediately).

## Inside the Tower

[[Pelanil]] is skeptical of the tower, and casts a spell to heal the party
