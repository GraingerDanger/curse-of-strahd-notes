## Journey to the Tower

The group sets off towards [[The Tower]] with [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]]. On the hour-and-a-half journey, [[Shalooti]] ponders how she might tame her polar bear once her spell wears off.

Near the end of the trip, the group hears wolves howling in the woods. [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] leaps into action, pulling her crossbow off her back and delivering two well-aimed slivered bolts into the woods. The howling immediately stops.

[[Escher]] and [[Anakir]] hold hands for most of the journey.

## The Tower on Lake Baratok

The party finally arrives at the lake. They see a small causeway leading over the water out to an old worn-down tower in the middle. There are deep tire tracks in the mud leading from the tower. When [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] sees them, she swears under her breath and takes off following the tracks into the woods, shouting to the party to go on without her.
