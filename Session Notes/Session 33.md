## Journey to the Tower

The group sets off towards [[Van Richten's Tower (V)|Van Richten's Tower]] with [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]]. On the hour-and-a-half journey, [[Shalooti]] ponders how she might tame her polar bear once her spell wears off.

[[Escher]] and [[Anakir]] hold hands for most of the journey.

Near the end of the trip, the group hears wolves howling in the woods. [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] leaps into action, pulling her crossbow off her back and delivering two well-aimed slivered bolts into the woods and presumably the bodies of the wolves, as the howling stops instantly.

## The Tower on Lake Baratok

The party finally arrives at the lake. They see a small causeway leading over the water out to an old worn-down tower in the middle of the lake. There are deep tire tracks in the mud leading from the tower. When [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] sees them, she curses under her breath and takes off following the tracks into the woods, shouting back to the party to go on without her.

## Dancing at the Door

[[Pelanil]] hesitates, but then follows after [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]]. The rest of the group heads towards the tower. [[Elora]] knocks on the door, but is blown backwards as the tower is consumed by blue lightning. From a distance, [[Elora]] more closely examines the door and realizes the sign depicts a dance. [[Shalooti]] knows exactly what to do. She busts a move!

Once she finishes all the dance moves, the lightning ceases and the door creaks open, revealing a small vestibule with lovely curtains ([[Bardolf]] snatches them immediately).

## Inside the Tower

[[Pelanil]] is skeptical of the tower, and casts a spell to heal the party. He feels his connection with [[Jesus|Jesus Christ of Nazareth]], but the spell has no effect.

The first floor is old and worn. In the middle of the room there is a square platform attached to chains on all four corners. By each chain stands a clay statue. [[Pelanil]] recognizes them as [[Golems|Clay Golems]]. [[Elora]] and [[Shalooti]] jump onto the small platform, followed immediately by everyone else except [[Pelanil]] and [[Bardolf]]. [[Pelanil]] claps his hands and the golems each grab their chain. [[Elora]] says "up", and the platform begins to rise ever... so.... slowly......

[[Pelanil]] climbs ahead up one of the chains, well outpacing the elevator. [[Shalooti]] attempts to follow, but slips only to be caught by [[Elora]].

After 2.5 minutes, the party finally arrives at the 4th floor.

## Van Richten's Hideaway

The fourth floor is obviously lived-in with creature comforts and tons of weapons, books, and potions. There is a fire in the stove, but no one seems to be around.

[[Anakir]] searches for a magic on-off switch to disable the apparent antimagic field. He only finds a wooden coat hook which he pulls off the wall and sharpens into a stake.

[[Elora]] and [[Shalooti]] find a severed [[Vistani]] head inside a chest. They just put it back and pretend they never saw it.

[[Pelanil]] finds a calligrapher's set and herbalist kit. As he's searching, he also finds a charred page from a journal, apparently meant to be burned: [[Van Richten's Journal Entry]].

From the note we learn:
- [[Rictavio|van Richten]] mercy killed his son after [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]]'s family kidnapped him
- A [[Vistani|Vistana]] cursed him saying, "Live you always among monsters, and see everyone you love die beneath their claws!"

## Van Richten's Arrival

 After[[Pelanil]] finishes reading the note, the elevator jerks back into motion. [[Shalooti]] finds and dons the [[Rictavio]] disguise, fooling no one.

After a full 5 minutes, [[Rictavio|van Richten]], [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]], and [[Bardolf]] arrive at the fourth floor.

[[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] introduces the party to [[Rictavio|van Richten]], who they've actually already met as [[Rictavio]]. She says that he had hidden her wagon in the woods for her, and she found him there when she went to look for it.

Before much time passed, [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] and [[Rictavio|van Richten]] start bickering which ultimately turns into a full blown fight. The arguing only stops once the party starts to gather on the elevator to leave.

[[Rictavio|van Richten]] begs them to stay, swearing they'll keep the fighting to a minimum.

The group talks shortly to [[Rictavio|van Richten]] and [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]]. When he asks about [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], [[Elora]] tells him [[Pelanil]] mercy killed her, "something you're familiar with".

From [[Rictavio|van Richten]] and [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]], the party learns the following:
- the [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]] is incredibly cold
	- they recommend gearing up either with magic or with clothing before embarking
- the path there is treacherous
	- [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] tried to go, but turned back
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] has actually been killed in a battle before, but he just came back to life a few days later
- There must be a way to kill him for good
	- The information is most likely housed at [[The Amber Temple (X)|The Amber Temple]]
