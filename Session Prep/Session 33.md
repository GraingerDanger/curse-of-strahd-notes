- [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] gets distracted because her wagon was pulled into the woods
	- So the party has to enter alone
	- Either [[Rictavio|van Richten]] hid it for her or someone stole it and it blew up in the woods
- van richten and Esmeralda tell the group that strahd has been straight up killed in battle before and just comes back
	- He's actually immortal
	- The answer to finally getting rid of him may be in the amber temple
		- The [[Heart of Sorrow Statblock]] is part of the reason
		- Also, his misty escape
		- If he's held in sunlight and can't transform
		- basically, if the party gets the info at the amber temple, just read the statblock to them
- Tell them its going to be cold at the [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]]
- Polar bear gets free will back after 24 hours
- Left out of [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]]'s story, [[Rictavio|van Richten]] actually mercy-killed his son
